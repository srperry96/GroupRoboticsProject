AX12 Servos (Arm/Gripper)
-----------------------------
- The servos are controlled using the arduino micro
- They rely on the DynamixelSerial1 library
-----------------------------
Install the library from: http://savageelectronics.blogspot.com/2011/08/actualizacion-biblioteca-dynamixel.html

NOTE: There are several versions, we want DynamixelSerial1.zip
(There is also a pdf containing details of the functions in the library)
-----------------------------
Once the library is imported into Arduino sketch (Sketch>Include Library>Add .ZIP Library), you must include it in your file using:
	#include <DynamixelSerial1.h>
-----------------------------
In your setup() function, you must use:
	Dynamixel.begin(1000000, 4);
- where 1000000 is the baud rate of the servos and 4 is the control pin (THESE VALUES ARE FIXED. DO NOT TRY ANYTHING ELSE!!!!)
-----------------------------
Now you can write any code for the arm control
- Useful functions:
	- Dynamixel.move(1, 200);
		- This moves servo ID 1 to position 200
		- The servos are set up with IDs 1,2,3,4
		- Position is any value from 0 - 1023
	- Dynamixel.readPosition(2)
		- This reads the position (0 - 1023) of servo ID 2
- For other functions see the .pdf mentioned earlier
