AX12a Servo Setup with Arduino Micro and 74LS241N Tristate buffer
Using library from Savage Electronics (DynamixelSerial1.zip - http://savageelectronics.blogspot.com/2011/08/actualizacion-biblioteca-dynamixel.html)
----------------------------
Hardware:
(See: http://savageelectronics.blogspot.com/2011/01/arduino-y-dynamixel-ax-12.html)
(Duplicate pins are not included in the below list)

- AX12A (Left Port) - Left Pin to 74LS241N Pin 3
		    - Middle Pin to +12v
		    - Right Pin to GND

- 74LS241N - Pin 3 to Pin 2
	   - Pin 2 to 10k resistor to +5V
	   - Pin 1 to Pin 19
	   - Pin 20 (Vcc) to +5V
	   - Pin 10 (GND) to GND

-Arduino Micro - (Provides +5V and GND. Ensure GND from +12V and +5V are connected!!)
	       - TX to 74LS241N Pin 17
	       - RX to 74LS241N Pin 18
	       - Pin 2 (Data control) to 74LS241N Pin 19
-----------------------------
Software:
- Simple arduino code
- Include the library
	#include <DynamixelSerial1.h> //AX12A servo library

- Setup the servo connection

	void setup() {
  		Dynamixel.begin(1000000, 2); //Initialise servo at 1Mbps. Control pin 2
 		delay(1000); //give the servo some time to set itself up
	}

- Use Dynamixel.move(1, 20); to set servo 1 to position 20 (position in range 0 - 1023, corresponds to angles 0-300 degrees)

- There is a user manual pdf for the library on the same page where it is downloaded
